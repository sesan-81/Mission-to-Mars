# Mission-to-Mars

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

The purpose of this project is to build a Web App that will scrape several websites for the most recent Mars data. The data is extracted and stored in a NoSQL database. The HTML page is created to display the findings.

SOFTWARE USED

The following software are used in this project:

•	Python 3.7

•	splinter 0.18.1

•	webdriver-manager 3.3.0

•	chromedriver 103.0.5060.53

•	Flask 1.1.2

•	Flask-PyMongo 2.0.1

•	BeautifulSoup (bs4) 3.1.9

•	html5lib 1.16.0

•	lxml 4.8.0

UPDATING THE WEB APP

Adding Bootstrap components, such as the code below, allowed the four Mars hemisphere images to be displayed side-by-side on Desktop browsers, instead of a line. This allows users to see all four images at once.
